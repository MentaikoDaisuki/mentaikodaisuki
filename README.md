# Welcome to My Alt Account! ðŸ‘‹

This is my alternative GitHub account, created for learning and practicing various programming skills and projects.  
Here, I explore new ideas, experiment with different frameworks, and improve my coding abilities without affecting my main account.

## About Me
I'm a gamer but also a programmer.  
I do content creation on YouTube and TikTok as a VTuber clipper.
And I also love Mentaiko! ðŸ˜‹
